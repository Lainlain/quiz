# Statistics Fix and Logo Branding Update

## Date: October 6, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Public Quiz Attempts Not Counted in Statistics**

**Problem**: When students took quizzes from the public quiz link (`/quiz?package=1`), their attempts were not being saved to the database, causing the statistics to show zero attempts.

**Root Cause**: In `web/static/js/quiz.js`, the `saveAttempt()` function was referencing incorrect variable names:
- Used: `this.course.id` and `this.quizPackage.id` (which don't exist)
- Should use: `this.courseId` and `this.quizPackageId`

**Fix**: Updated `quiz.js` line ~220:
```javascript
// BEFORE (Incorrect - causes undefined values)
body: JSON.stringify({
    student_name: this.studentName,
    course_id: this.course.id,           // ‚ùå Wrong
    quiz_package_id: this.quizPackage.id, // ‚ùå Wrong
    // ...
})

// AFTER (Correct)
body: JSON.stringify({
    student_name: this.studentName,
    course_id: this.courseId,            // ‚úÖ Correct
    quiz_package_id: this.quizPackageId, // ‚úÖ Correct
    // ...
})
```

**Result**: Now when students complete quizzes via public link, their attempts are properly saved and counted in statistics.

## Technical Details

### Backend API (No Changes Required)
The backend `POST /api/quiz/submit` endpoint was already working correctly:
- Endpoint: `/api/quiz/submit` in `internal/handlers/student.go`
- Creates guest user: `guest_{name}@guest.local`
- Saves attempt with all details
- Returns success response with attempt ID

### Frontend JavaScript Fix
The issue was purely in the frontend JavaScript variable references. The data flow is now:
```
1. Student completes quiz
2. quiz.js calls saveAttempt()
3. POST /api/quiz/submit with correct course_id and quiz_package_id
4. Backend saves to database
5. Statistics endpoint includes the new attempt
```

### Logo Implementation
All logos use the same CSS classes for consistency:
- **Rounded**: `rounded-full`
- **Object fit**: `object-cover` (prevents distortion)
- **Border**: Various styles (white/gray borders depending on background)
- **Shadow**: `shadow-lg` for elevation effect

## Before vs After

### Before Fix:
- ‚ùå Public quiz attempts: Not saved to database

- ‚ùå Branding: Generic emoji icons

### After Fix:

## Browser Cache Clearing

If changes don't appear immediately:
1. **Hard refresh**: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Linux/Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
2. **Or clear cache**: Browser settings ‚Üí Clear browsing data ‚Üí Cached images and files

---

## Deployment Notes

When deploying to production:
1. Ensure `logo.jpg` is in `web/static/` folder
2. Verify logo file permissions: `chmod 644 web/static/logo.jpg`
3. No server rebuild required (templates/JS only)
4. Test with incognito window to verify cache clearing

‚úÖ **Enhanced**: Professional logo branding added to all pages  
‚úÖ **Tested**: Both fixes verified in local environment  
‚úÖ **Ready**: No server rebuild needed, just refresh browser
