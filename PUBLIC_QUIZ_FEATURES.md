# Public Quiz Features - Summary

## ✅ Implemented Features

### 1. **Retry Limit (3 Attempts Maximum)**
- **Location**: `/internal/handlers/student.go` - `SubmitPublicQuiz()` function
- **How it works**:
  - Checks device_id before allowing quiz submission
  - Counts completed attempts for the same device + quiz package
  - If count >= 3, returns **403 Forbidden** with error message
  - Frontend shows alert: "You have already taken this quiz 3 times"

**Testing**:
1. Take quiz from: `http://localhost:8080/quiz?package=1`
2. Complete and submit 3 times
3. On 4th attempt, you'll see the retry limit message

### 2. **Student Name & Device ID Saved**
- **Location**: `/internal/handlers/student.go` - `SubmitPublicQuiz()` function
- **What gets saved**:
  - ✅ Student name → Creates guest user in `users` table
  - ✅ Device ID → SHA-256 fingerprint saved in `attempts.device_id`
  - ✅ Course ID → Links attempt to course
  - ✅ Quiz Package ID → Links attempt to specific quiz
  - ✅ Score, answers, time taken

**Database Check**:
```bash
sqlite3 quiz.db "SELECT a.id, u.name, a.score, a.total_points, a.device_id, a.created_at FROM attempts a JOIN users u ON a.student_id = u.id ORDER BY a.id DESC LIMIT 5;"
```

### 3. **Course Statistics (Student Attempts Overview)**
- **API Endpoint**: `GET /api/admin/courses/:id/stats`
- **Location**: `/internal/handlers/course.go` - `GetCourseStats()` function
- **Dashboard**: Click 👥 icon next to any course in admin dashboard

**Shows**:
- **Total Attempts** - All quiz attempts for this course
